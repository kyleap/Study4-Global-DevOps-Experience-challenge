# Redeem your Copilot Coupon

To work with Copilot you need a subscription. Because we do want to interfere with existing subscriptions from companies, we created coupons for this that you can redeem.

Please follow the next steps carefully to redeem your Copilot trial subscription. The coupon gives access to Copilot for 7 days.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have a an existing Copilot license assigned, DO NOT USE THE COUPON! Otherwise your current license will be reset and the token stops working in 7 days

Click on the "Get access to GitHub Copilot" button

## :rocket: Step 5
Configure Copilot so it will not feed your data into the model for training purposes. This is done by **de-selecting** the option `Allow GitHub to use my code snippets for product improvements`

One other setting that is important is that you Allow or Disallow the use of public matching code. Disallow this if you are worried about GPL licenced code that migth get sugegsted to you, that could potentialy get you into the obligtion to also publish your own code.

## Step 6 :tada: You are done and ready to use Copilot!
