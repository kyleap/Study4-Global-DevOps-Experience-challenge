## GitHub Advanced security

## Turn on GHAS and activate all its features
First we need to setup GHAS.. That is simple. Just follow instruction here --> [Link to Github](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/code-security/getting-started/github-security-features)
Make sure you switch on all features.

## Generate SBOM

A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a detailed list that outlines all the components contained within a piece of software. This includes both direct and indirect dependencies, such as libraries, packages, and modules, sourced from third-party providers. An SBOM is analogous to an ingredients list on a food product, providing transparency about what's inside the software.

Exporting an SBOM is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Security:** By exporting an SBOM, organizations can more easily identify and manage security vulnerabilities within their software components. It allows for rapid assessment and mitigation when a security flaw is discovered in one of the included components.

2. **Compliance:** Many industries are subject to regulatory requirements that mandate transparency about software components, especially in critical infrastructure or in products that handle sensitive data. An SBOM helps in demonstrating compliance with such regulations.

3. **Software Assurance:** Exporting an SBOM helps in the management of software licenses and ensures compliance with open-source licenses. It also aids in avoiding potential legal issues that might arise from the misuse of proprietary or open-source software.

4. **Supply Chain Management:** In today's interconnected software development ecosystem, an SBOM provides a clear view of the software supply chain. It helps organizations track the origin and integrity of each component, enhancing the overall security posture against supply chain attacks.

Thus, an SBOM not only enhances the transparency and security of software but also supports compliance, legal, and operational practices. Exporting and maintaining up-to-date SBOMs are becoming a best practice in software development and management.

## Dependabot

GitHub Dependabot is an automated tool integrated within GitHub that helps developers maintain the security and reliability of their software dependencies. Dependabot regularly scans a projectâ€™s dependency files, such as those from package managers like npm, Maven, or Pip, and identifies outdated or vulnerable libraries. When it detects a dependency that needs updating, Dependabot automatically generates pull requests to update the dependency to the latest version, which can include patches for security vulnerabilities or other critical bugs.

Using GitHub Dependabot is highly beneficial for several reasons:

1. **Enhanced security:** Dependabot helps protect applications from security vulnerabilities by ensuring that dependencies are up-to-date with the latest security patches. This proactive measure reduces the risk of exploitable vulnerabilities present in older versions.

2. **Time efficiency:** By automating the process of updating dependencies, Dependabot saves developers considerable time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually tracking and updating each dependency. This allows developers to focus more on developing features and improving their products.

3. **Improved reliability:** Regular updates ensure that the software uses the most stable versions of dependencies, which can improve overall reliability and performance. Dependabot also minimizes compatibility issues by ensuring that updates are compatible with the rest of the softwareâ€™s ecosystem.

4. **Simplicity and ease of use:** Dependabot is integrated directly into GitHub, making it easy to set up and use as part of the normal workflow without the need for additional tools or platforms.

Overall, GitHub Dependabot is an essential tool for any development team that aims to maintain high standards of software security and integrity, while also optimizing development workflows.

## Code scanning

GitHub Code Scanning is a developer tool integrated within GitHub that allows for the automated scanning of codebases to identify security vulnerabilities and coding errors. This tool utilizes GitHub Actions or third-party integrations to continuously analyze the code every time a new commit or pull request is made, checking for potential security issues or bugs that could compromise the software's integrity.

The benefits of using GitHub Code Scanning are manifold:

1. **Proactive security measures:** By scanning code for vulnerabilities before it is merged into the main branch, GitHub Code Scanning helps prevent security issues from reaching production. This early detection is crucial in reducing the risk of security breaches.

2. **Streamlined code reviews:** The tool highlights potential problems directly in pull requests, making it easier for developers to review code changes. This integration not only saves time but also enhances the quality of peer reviews by focusing attention on possible issues.

3. **Compliance assurance:** For organizations that must adhere to specific coding standards and security regulations, GitHub Code Scanning ensures that all code complies with these rules before it is deployed. This is essential for maintaining regulatory compliance and avoiding penalties.

4. **Developer education:** Regular exposure to the issues flagged by automated scanning helps developers learn about common mistakes and best practices in real time, improving their coding skills and awareness of security practices.

Overall, GitHub Code Scanning is an essential tool for any development team that prioritizes security and quality in their software development processes. It seamlessly integrates security into the development workflow, ensuring that vulnerabilities are addressed swiftly and efficiently.

## Fix OWASP related to sql

Addressing and fixing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities, particularly those related to SQL injection, is critical for securing web applications. The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly updated report outlining the most critical security risks to web applications. SQL injection (SQLi) vulnerabilities, where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution, rank high on this list due to their potential to compromise the security of a database.

**Steps to address SQL injection vulnerabilities:**

1. **Use prepared statements and parameterized queries:** These methods ensure that an attacker cannot change the intent of a query, even if SQL commands are inserted by an attacker. For SQL, most modern SQL databases support this feature.

2. **Employ stored procedures:** By using stored procedures, you can avoid direct SQL queries from user inputs. This encapsulates the SQL within the database and minimizes the surface area for attack.

3. **Implement proper error handling:** Do not expose database error information to the end users. Errors can provide clues that help attackers tailor further attacks.

4. **Regularly update and patch:** Keep your database management systems (DBMS) and applications up to date with the latest security patches and updates.

5. **Perform security testing:** Regularly test your web applications for vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual penetration testing.

**Further learning and documentation:**

For practical guides on how to implement these measures and fix vulnerabilities related to SQL practices, here are some useful links to the official documentation and resources:

- [OWASP SQL injection prevention cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html): This cheat sheet provides a concise collection of high value information on specific application security topics.

- [OWASP testing guide for SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/05-Testing_for_SQL_Injection.html): This guide helps understand how to test web applications for SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

- [Parameterized queries in SQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/sql-injection?view=sql-server-ver16): Microsoftâ€™s guide on using parameters with SQL commands to prevent SQL injection.

These resources will provide a comprehensive overview and detailed guidelines on how to effectively safeguard your applications from SQL-related vulnerabilities within the OWASP Top 10 list.
